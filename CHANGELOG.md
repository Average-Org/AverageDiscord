### 🔄 Changed

- **Configuration structure**: Single channel → multi-channel array
  ```json
  // Old
  "mainChatChannelId": "123456789"

  // New
  "channels": [{"channelId": "123456789", "type": ["all"]}]
  ```
- **Message delivery**: Type-based routing instead of broadcasting to single channel
- **New config field**: `showActivePlayerCount` for optional player count display

### 📝 Note

**Configuration migration required** - Update your `discord_bridge.json` file to the new format. To do so, simply delete the old config and let it be recreated on startup.
